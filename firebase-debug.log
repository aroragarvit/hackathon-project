You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  /home/garvit/programming/hackathon-project

[info] 
=== Project Setup

[info] First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
[info] You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
[info] but for now we'll just set up a default project.
